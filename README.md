## Project 1

### Create Your Own Private Blockchain
I crafted a secluded blockchain geared towards documenting star ownership. Formulated as an `express.js` application, I orchestrated the logic within `src/block.js` and `src/blockchain.js`, bestowing the capability to authenticate blockchain blocks, decode their contents, and formulate a series of interconnected blocks primed for endorsement via an Electrum wallet. Additionally, the project establishes access points for querying blocks based on factors such as block height, block hash, and the wallet address responsible for signing the block.
